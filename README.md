DFRobot-Nixie-Clock
===================

Arduino Nixie clock made with 4 Nixie modules from DFRobot. This project requires the following components:
4 Nixie Modules from DFRobot (robotmesh.com in the U.S. for faster shipping times).  
Ask for the Nixie Module acrylic backing plate which holds four modules together and reduces the stress on the connectors. They tossed in one for free with my order without my even asking for it. The people at DFRobot have been great.
1 Arduino Uno or equivalent
1 TinyRTC module or any other equivalent RTC chip.
12 Volt power supply capable of deliveing a solid 1 Amp of regulated voltage. Nixie's are power hungry little beasts.
3M Dual Lock industrial strength velcro.
A 2.1x5mm power jack and associated connecting wires and plugs.
An artistic case of your imagination.  Mine was a second hand Japanese wood shipping container from a local shop.

Use the time setting sketch to set the clock time and date.
Then, upload the clock sketch to the Arduino.
Enjoy and share liberally.
